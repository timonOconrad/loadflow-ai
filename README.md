## Grid:
An IEEE 5 test grid was used as the grid, in which the values at the buses were varied. More information on this can be found in the master's thesis (https://github.com/timonOconrad/static-voltage-stability-AI/blob/main/masterarbeit_final.pdf) in the chapter on data generation.

## Note:
We use the preparatory work from the following repo (https://github.com/timonOconrad/static-voltage-stability-AI).
